# Python + FastAPI + OAuth2 Password Bearer + JWT Auth + RAG + Hugging Face Embeddings

A production-style **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API** built with **FastAPI**.

This project combines **OAuth2 Password Bearer authentication**, **JWT access tokens**, **PostgreSQL + pgvector vector search**, **Hugging Face embeddings**, and **Groq LLMs** to deliver context-aware answers from your own data.

The RAG pipeline returns source references **only when sufficiently relevant information is retrieved from PostgreSQL**. If no relevant database content is found, the LLM can answer normally without returning a source.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication

- OAuth2 Password Bearer authentication
- JWT access tokens (HS256)
- Swagger UI OAuth2 authorization support
- Protected endpoints using Bearer tokens
- Separate login endpoint for SPA clients (`/login-spa`)
- Environment-based credentials

### 🧠 RAG Pipeline

- Ingests `.txt` documents from URLs
- Splits content into topic-based chunks
- Generates embeddings using Hugging Face
- Stores vectors in PostgreSQL with pgvector
- Performs semantic vector retrieval
- Uses a relevance threshold to prevent unrelated documents from being used
- Returns source URLs only when relevant RAG content is retrieved
- Falls back to the LLM when no relevant RAG content is found

### 🤖 LLM Integration

- Groq API
- Model: `openai/gpt-oss-20b`
- Context-aware answer generation
- Structured prompting for retrieved RAG context
- Normal LLM responses when no relevant database context exists

### 🔎 Semantic Search

The retrieval pipeline uses:

- Query → embedding
- PostgreSQL + pgvector similarity search
- Cosine distance using `<->`
- Maximum of 3 retrieved chunks
- Relevance threshold of 1.10

Only documents with a cosine distance of `<= 1.10` are considered sufficiently relevant.

This prevents PostgreSQL from returning the closest available document simply because a query has no genuinely relevant match.

### 🗄️ Vector Database

PostgreSQL with pgvector stores:

- Document content
- Embeddings
- Source URL
- Embedding model
- Embedding version
- Timestamp

Optimizations include:

- `VECTOR(384)` column
- `ivfflat` index
- Normalized embeddings
- Cosine-distance based similarity search

### ⚙️ Background Processing

- FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`
- Background document ingestion
- Batched embedding generation
- Batched PostgreSQL inserts

### 🧪 Debug Tools

The `/debug/retrieve` endpoint can be used to inspect the RAG retrieval process without invoking the LLM.

It returns:

- Original query
- Number of retrieved documents
- Retrieved content
- Source URL
- Retrieval distance

### 1. Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

    python -m venv venv

Activate it on Windows PowerShell:

    venv\Scripts\activate

Activate it on Mac/Linux:

    source venv/bin/activate

### 3. Install Dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## ▶️ Run the Application

    uvicorn app:app --reload

Once running:

- API: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Swagger Docs: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

### Using Swagger UI

1. Open `/docs`
2. Click **Authorize**
3. Sign in using your username and password through the OAuth2 Password flow
4. Swagger automatically stores and sends the Bearer token for protected endpoints

---

## 🔑 Authentication Flow

### Swagger / API Clients

1. Call `/token` using the OAuth2 Password flow
2. Receive a JWT access token
3. Use the token automatically through Swagger or manually with:

    Authorization: Bearer <your_token>

### SPA Clients

Frontend applications can authenticate via:

    POST /login-spa

The endpoint returns a JWT access token for subsequent authenticated requests.

---

## 🧠 How RAG Works

The current RAG flow is:

    User Query
        ↓
    Hugging Face Embedding
        ↓
    pgvector Similarity Search
        ↓
    Relevance Filtering
        ↓
    Groq LLM
        ↓
    Answer + Optional Sources

The retrieval stage uses:

- Maximum of 3 chunks
- Cosine distance using pgvector `<->`
- Relevance threshold of 1.10

The important distinction is that the system does not automatically consider the closest database result relevant.

If no retrieved document has a distance of `<= 1.10`, the database is considered to have no relevant information for the question.

The LLM then answers without RAG context and the API returns an empty `sources` array.

---

## 🔎 Retrieval Configuration

The retrieval function currently uses:

    def retrieve(query: str, k: int = 3, threshold: float = 1.10):

The PostgreSQL query:

1. Generates an embedding for the user question
2. Calculates vector distance against stored document embeddings
3. Filters results using the `1.10` threshold
4. Orders results by distance
5. Returns up to 3 relevant chunks

This prevents weak semantic matches from unnecessarily being passed to the LLM as RAG context.

### Why the threshold matters

Vector search will normally return the closest available documents, even when none are actually relevant.

For example, a question about France could still return documents about Vercel, MySQL, or Java because those documents are the closest available vectors.

The `1.10` threshold prevents those weak matches from being treated as relevant RAG context.

---

## 📚 Source Handling

Sources are returned based on actual successful RAG retrieval.

### Example: Source Triggered

Question:

    What is Vercel?

The database contains:

    Topic: Vercel Vercel provides serverless hosting with devops.

A retrieval distance around `1.02` is below the `1.10` threshold, so the document is accepted.

The API can return:

    {
      "answer": "Vercel provides serverless hosting with DevOps...",
      "sources": [
        "https://vanillajs.persteenolsen.com/rag-data-three.txt"
      ]
    }

The exact answer generated by the LLM may vary.

### Example: Source Not Triggered

Question:

    What is the capital of France?

No sufficiently relevant database document is found.

The LLM therefore answers normally without RAG context.

The API returns:

    {
      "answer": "The capital of France is Paris.",
      "sources": []
    }

Another example:

    Tell me a joke

If no relevant RAG document exists:

    {
      "answer": "Why did the...",
      "sources": []
    }

The exact LLM-generated answer will vary.

---

## 🧪 Debug Retrieval

The `/debug/retrieve` endpoint is useful for checking PostgreSQL retrieval without invoking the LLM.

Example request:

    What is Vercel?

Example response:

    {
      "query": "What is Vercel",
      "count": 1,
      "results": [
        {
          "content": "Topic: Vercel Vercel provides serverless hosting with devops.",
          "source": "https://vanillajs.persteenolsen.com/rag-data-three.txt",
          "distance": 1.0187737585000414
        }
      ]
    }

Because `1.0187 <= 1.10`, the document is considered relevant.

For an unrelated question such as:

    Tell me a joke

The endpoint can return:

    {
      "query": "Tell me a joke",
      "count": 0,
      "results": []
    }

This means no sufficiently relevant document was found in PostgreSQL.

The endpoint is protected by JWT authentication.

---

## 📥 Document Ingestion

### `/ingest`

The ingestion endpoint:

1. Accepts a `.txt` file URL
2. Downloads and validates the document
3. Cleans the text
4. Splits the document into topic-based chunks
5. Generates embeddings using Hugging Face
6. Stores chunks and embeddings in PostgreSQL
7. Stores the original source URL
8. Processes the work as a FastAPI background task

The `/ingest` route itself was not changed when the retrieval threshold was introduced.

The threshold only affects retrieval after documents have already been ingested.

Changing the retrieval threshold does not require existing documents to be re-ingested.

---

## 🧾 Embeddings

- Model: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- 384-dimensional vectors
- Normalized embeddings
- Batch processing
- Retry support
- Hugging Face Inference API

The embedding model and version are stored with each document to support future embedding migrations.

---

## 🗄️ Database Initialization

On application startup:

- Creates the `pgvector` extension
- Creates the `documents` table if it does not exist
- Creates the `ivfflat` vector index

The `documents` table contains:

- `id`
- `content`
- `embedding`
- `source`
- `embedding_model`
- `embedding_version`
- `created_at`

---

## 🛠️ Text Processing

The ingestion pipeline:

- Fetches `.txt` files from URLs
- Validates the HTTP response
- Validates the content type or `.txt` extension
- Removes empty lines
- Cleans text
- Splits documents whenever a line begins with `Topic:`

For example, a document containing multiple `Topic:` sections becomes multiple searchable chunks.

---

## 📊 Current Retrieval Configuration

| Setting | Current Value |
|---------|---------------|
| Embedding model | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` |
| Vector dimensions | 384 |
| Retrieval method | pgvector cosine distance |
| Maximum retrieved chunks | 3 |
| Relevance threshold | 1.10 |
| LLM | `openai/gpt-oss-20b` |
| Vector index | IVFFlat |

The `1.10` threshold is based on the current document collection and observed retrieval distances.

It may need to be adjusted as the knowledge base grows or the embedding strategy changes.

## 🙌 Final Notes

This project is designed as a **clean, production-style RAG backend** that can serve multiple clients.

The FastAPI API can be extended into:

- Chatbots
- Internal knowledge systems
- AI assistants
- Document search platforms
- Enterprise knowledge applications

The current implementation deliberately separates retrieval from answer generation.

When relevant information is found in PostgreSQL:

- The relevant chunks are passed to the LLM
- The LLM uses that context to answer the question
- The API returns the corresponding source URL

When no sufficiently relevant information is found:

- No RAG context is passed to the LLM
- The LLM can answer normally
- The API returns `sources: []`

This prevents unrelated database documents from being presented as sources simply because they happened to be the closest vector matches.

A Vue 3 SPA frontend is included as a separate client application, demonstrating how to securely integrate authentication, API communication, and RAG-based question answering into a modern web application.

Happy coding :-)
